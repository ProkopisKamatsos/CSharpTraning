# Implement Tasks Asynchronously and in Parallel

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **C# Console Application** that demonstrates how to execute operations **asynchronously** and **in parallel** using the **Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)**.

It was developed as a practice project to understand concurrency, non-blocking execution, and performance improvement in C# applications.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Understand **async / await** in C#
- Execute tasks **asynchronously**
- Run multiple operations **in parallel**
- Improve application responsiveness
- Learn how to manage concurrent workflows

- Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)
- `async` and `await`
- `Task.Run`
- Parallel task execution
- Synchronization and task coordination
- Exception handling in async code
- Console-based async flow
