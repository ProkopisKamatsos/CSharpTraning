# Console Calculator with Basic Operations

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple **console-based calculator** application written in C#.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through user input.

It was created as a practical exercise to practice user interaction, control flow, and basic logic in C#.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Practice reading input from the console
- Implement core arithmetic logic
- Use control structures (`if`, `switch`, loops)
- Improve confidence building simple C# applications
- Understand basic error handling (e.g., division by zero)

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Console input and output
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (`if`, `switch`)
- Arithmetic operators
- Looping constructs
- Basic error and input validation
