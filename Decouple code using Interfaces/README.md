# Decouple Code Using Interfaces

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **interfaces** in C# to **decouple** code and make it easier to maintain, test, and extend.  
The focus is on separating *what a component does* (the contract) from *how it does it* (the implementation).

## 🎯 Purpose
- Reduce dependencies between classes by relying on **interfaces**
- Make implementations interchangeable without changing the consuming code
- Practice writing cleaner architecture with better separation of concerns
- Understand how interfaces improve maintainability and testing

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Interface contracts and implementations
- Loose coupling (depend on abstractions, not concrete classes)
- Polymorphism via interface references
- Swapping implementations (same interface, different behavior)
- Cleaner structure and responsibility separation

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **C#**
- **.NET** (practice project)
