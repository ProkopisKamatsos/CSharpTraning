# 🚀 C# Training Repository

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository represents my **personal learning journey in C# and .NET**.

It contains a collection of exercises, small projects, and practice applications that I created while studying and experimenting with different concepts of the C# programming language and the .NET ecosystem.
