# Create Flexible Code Using Interfaces

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on using **interfaces** in C# to write code that is **flexible, reusable, and easier to extend**.  
It demonstrates how to program against an abstraction (interface) instead of a concrete class, so implementations can be swapped without changing the consuming code.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice defining and implementing **interfaces**
- Decouple code by depending on **abstractions** instead of concrete types
- Understand how interfaces enable **polymorphism** and cleaner design
- Build a small example where multiple implementations can be used interchangeably

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Interface definition and implementation
- Programming to an interface (abstraction-first design)
- Polymorphism via interface references
- Loose coupling and separation of concerns
- Swappable implementations (same contract, different behavior)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C#**
- **.NET** (practice project)
