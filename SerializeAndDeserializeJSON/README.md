# Serialize and Deserialize JSON Files

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **C# Console Application** that demonstrates how to **serialize and deserialize JSON data** using built-in .NET libraries.

It was developed as a practice project to understand how objects are converted to JSON format and restored back into strongly typed C# objects.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Understand **JSON serialization and deserialization**
- Convert C# objects to JSON files
- Read JSON files and map them back to objects
- Work with file I/O operations
- Practice data persistence in console applications
